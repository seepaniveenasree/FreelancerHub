The modern world is witnessing a remarkable shift toward online freelancing platforms where individuals can offer their skills and clients can find the right talent for their work. The Freelancer Hub project is a web-based system designed to bridge the gap between clients and freelancers. It acts as a common space where clients can post their project requirements, and freelancers can browse through available projects, apply for suitable ones, and collaborate efficiently.
This project aims to simplify the process of hiring freelancers and managing freelance projects by creating a user-friendly and efficient online platform. It eliminates the need for manual searching, messaging, and tracking of work progress by bringing everything under a single system.
The project provides two different user roles: Client and Freelancer. Each role has its own dashboard, features, and functionalities. Clients can post projects, assign freelancers, track progress, and provide feedback. Freelancers, on the other hand, can register themselves, create their profiles, browse available projects, apply for them, and communicate with clients regarding project status.
The application follows a modular architecture and uses Spring Boot and MongoDB on the backend, ensuring flexibility, simplicity, and scalability.
